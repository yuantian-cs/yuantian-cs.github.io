Education
======
*  **University of Nottingham**, Nottingham, United Kingdom, 2017 -- 2021 (expected)
   * **Ph.D.** in Computer Science
 
 * **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications** (BUPT), Beijing, China, 2008 -- 2015
   * **M.E.** and **B.E.** in Computer Science and Technology



Professional Experiences
======
* May 2017 - Present: **Yahoo! Labs** Collaborative Research Program, London, United Kingdom
  * Established long-term cooperation with Yahoo! Research on my PhD work for inferring users' needs and tasks on mobile devices.  By leveraging the large-scale dataset of real-life app usage logs, we proposed and implemented:
    * a framework for tackling the novel app engagement prediction problem on simultaneously predicting both what app user will use and how long the user will stay on that app
    * an enhanced app usage prediction model based on the user cohort modelling approach
    * task detection models based on supervised machine learning classifiers with various features and discovered common mobile task types that span multiple apps based on the clustering approach
    * demographics prediction models based on users? mobile app tasks with deep learning models (i.e.CNN and LSTM)
  
  
* Aug 2015  -- Nov 2016: **Dartmouth College** Research Assistant, NH, United States
  * Implemented the online learning of GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models) in Matlab
  * Optimized the online learning GMM method by several strategies (i.e., stratified sampling, SVD constraints, and scalar covariance update function) for simulating the pixel intensities of the imagein a more accurate and robust fashion.
  * Teaching Assistant in Courses : Problem Solving via Object-Oriented Programming; Machine Learningand Statistical Data Analysis; Computer Networks; Full-stack Web Development
