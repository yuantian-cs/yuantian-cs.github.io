*  **University of Nottingham**, Nottingham, UK, 2017 -- 2021 (expected)
   * **Ph.D.** in Computer Science
 
 * **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications** (BUPT), Beijing, China, 2008 -- 2015
   * **M.E.** and **B.E.** in Computer Science and Technology



Professional Experiences
======
* 2017 - Present: **Yahoo! Labs** Collaborative Research Program, London, UK
  * Established long-term cooperation with Yahoo! Research on my PhD work for inferring users' needs and tasks on mobile devices.  By leveraging the large-scale dataset of real-life app usage logs, we proposed and implemented:
    * a framework for tackling the novel app engagement prediction problem on simultaneously predicting both what app user will use and how long the user will stay on that app
    * an enhanced app usage prediction model based on the user cohort modelling approach
    * task detection models based on supervised machine learning classifiers with various features and discovered common mobile task types that span multiple apps based on the clustering approach
    * demographics prediction models based on users? mobile app tasks with deep learning models (i.e.CNN and LSTM)
  
  
  
  
* Fall 2015: Research Assistant
  * Github University
  * Duties included: Merging pull requests
  * Supervisor: Professor Hub
