* I am currently the fourth year PhD student in the school of computer science, [University of Nottingham] (https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/), United Kingdom, advised by [Dr. Ke (Adam) Zhou] (https://sites.google.com/site/keadamzhou/). 
* I received my master's and bachelor's degree both from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. 
* My research interests and expertise lie in mobile computing, data mining, applied machine learning, behaviour learning, user modelling and recommender systems. Specifically, my PhD project is mainly about inferring users' needs and tasks from app usage interactions based on a large-scale dataset that covers more than 12K anonymous users and 1.3 million log events.
