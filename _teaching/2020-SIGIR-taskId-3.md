Abstract
======
Mobile devices have become an increasingly ubiquitous part of our everyday life. We use mobile services to perform a broad range of tasks (e.g. booking travel or office work), leading to often lengthy interactions within distinct apps and services. Existing mobile systems handle mostly simple user needs, where a single app is taken as the unit of interaction. To understand users' expectations and to provide context-aware services, it is important to model users' interactions in the task space. In this work, we first propose and evaluate a method for the automated segmentation of users' app usage logs into task units. We focus on two problems: (i) given a sequential pair of app usage logs, identify if there exists a task boundary, and (ii) given any pair of two app usage logs, identify if they belong to the same task. We model these as classification problems that use features from three aspects of app usage patterns: temporal, similarity, and log sequence. Our classifiers improve on traditional timeout segmentation, achieving over 89% performance for both problems. Secondly, we use our best task classifier on a large-scale data set of commercial mobile app usage logs to identify common tasks. We observe that users' performed common tasks ranging from regular information checking to entertainment and booking dinner. Our proposed task identification approach provides the means to evaluate mobile services and applications with respect to task completion.
